* Did you get overall view of the product?  
  Yes. It was clearly presented.

* How was the slideset?  
  The slideset was good and clear.

* Was the presentation fluent? Body language? Language, quality of the speech?  
  The presentation was fluent. Body language was good. You could have talked a bit more calmer. Sometimes the speech was a bit too rushed but mostly it was fluent and nice. The volume of the speech was loud enough.
 
* Additional notes and comments  
  Very good mock-ups. The idea of the application is good
