* Did you get overall view of the product?  
  Yes. It was clearly presented.

* How was the slideset?  
  The slideset was good and clear.

* Was the presentation fluent? Body language? Language, quality of the speech?  
  The presentation was fluent. Body language was good. You could have talked a bit more calmer. Sometimes the speech was a bit too rushed but mostly it was fluent and nice. The volume of the speech was loud enough.
 
* Additional notes and comments  
  Very good mock-ups. The idea of the application is good

#### Document review

**Link to the documentation:** Click [here](https://github.com/julia-sulina/GroupProject/blob/master/SRS.md "Documentation").

**Review the following parts of the documentation.**<BR/>
**For each section / part, describe the following:**
* Is all the content there?
* What was bad in the specific part, how it could be improved?
* What was good in the specific part?

**Parts to review:**

1. **introduction (=first section) + project management (=last section)**
  Very thorough introduction, maybe even too thorough.
1. **use cases**
  Good user definitions and use case diagram. Well thought scenarios that could happen.
  Flowchart could've had a nicer structure. A little overwhelming as is.
1. **system overview**
  Too many modules, not all high level main modules.
  The ones listed are well explained.
1. **requirements, functional & non-functional**
  Functional requirements take into consideration everything possible.
  More thought into non-functional requirements.
1. **user interface**
  Very nice interface sketches.
  The map doesn't show up very well from the dark background
