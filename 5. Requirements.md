**Plan route page:** 
-Start point and end point accept only alphabetical characters.

Usability
-----------
To make the system easy to use, the mock-ups and design must work as expected, which means that the system feels 
natural to use. All of the buttons are where expected, main page is easy to find, and all is all we have to design 
the system in a way that is used in other softwares too, so even if the user is using it for the first time, 
it's easy to assume where different options and functions can be found. So in addition to the standard placing of the
elements the colors are used as guidelines, separating for example friends with green and foes with red color.

Reliability
-------------

Some possible system failures: The network connection is not available, the phone runs out of battery or 
the application crashes

The network connection is not available: If the user doesn't have network from the start, he can open the application,
edit account information and go through his lists of friends and foes, but he cannot plan a route or get locations. 
If he gets the network connection, his friends and foes appear to the map, and he can use the whole application, without 
needing to start it again.
If the user has the connection, but looses it in the middle of using the application, the user can still see the friends, 
foes and himself going around in the school area, but cannot see the statuses changing. 

The battery runs out: When the battery runs out, unsaved data is lost, including locations and a halfway-through routes.
But otherwise the application should work normally when started again and not give an error.

Application crashes: If the application crashes, the consequence is teh same as if when the phone shuts down during using 
the application.

Efficiency
-----------

The application is downloaded to every users phone, so it shouldn't crash because of too many users at the same time. 
What might cause some problems, is the poor working of the wireless access points in the school area. If the access 
points don't work well, it affects the application also, and might cause a "bottleneck-effect", which means that the 
requests get lined-up, and are handled in chronological order. If the request is taking too long, it is aborted, then
the user has to resend the request.

Metrics
--------

In our software, we should definitely keep track on bugs per line of code, code coverage, number
of lines of code and program execution time, load time and size.

Our code coverage would be high, because we will have to do a lot of testing, to prevent bugs from appearing in the final
version and updates. When executing the test suite, we calculate the code coverage with the percent of program subroutines 
and the percent of program statements. We have to try to find all of the bugs, so that the application doesn't crash, 
freeze, give errors or allow a user to obtain unauthorized privileges. 

Source lines of code (SLOC) then is used to estimate the programming productivity and maintainability. The lines also 
reduce the size of the code, and so affect the program execution and load time.
