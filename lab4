****************************************
Introduction
****************************************
-What is the project?
  The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) will implement a ‘portal’, as a
  single point of contact through which everyone interested in Health Research will
  access information about research and manage the life-cycles of research projects.
-Overall description of the product
  The secure, internet web-based NIHR portal will provide a single gateway to
  applications for the broad community of NIHR stakeholders; and to information and
  knowledge bases designed around the needs of particular stakeholder communities
  such as researchers, research networks, R&D managers, funders and sponsors,
  including the Department of Health.
-Target audience?
  The portal will provide a single gateway to applications, information and knowledge
  bases for the broad community of NIHR stakeholders including researchers, R&D
  managers, Department of Health managers and the research networks.
-The situation?
	There is no such system in place at the moment.
-Motivation?
  In January 2006, ‘Best Research for Best Health’ (BRfBH) was published, a strategy
  that describes how the Government intends to make the UK the best place in the
  world for health research, development and innovation.
-Structure
	The structure is pretty much the same as in the Wikipedia example. It includes the introduction, overall description and requirements.

Usecases

-What the system (will) do?
Store information, like medical conditions, projects, general policy
-How cases are described, how much details?
Use cases are various, and some user types might have many kind of projects and trials to take care of, so all of 
them are not listed in the document, which is understandable. So everything is not fully detailed, but explanations 
cover enough.

****************************************
General stucture of the system
****************************************
There is only one flow chart.

****************************************
Functional & non-functional requirements
****************************************
The phasing of requirements are listed in a table (p.18). These are all functional requirements.
Some non-functional requirements are given in the document such as performance requirements and compliance with 
general and accessibility standards. Reliability, availability, maintainability and security are also considered as
non-functional requirements.

****************************************
How does (will) it look?
****************************************

-UI examples / views?
  In the document the following is stated:

  The portal and all its publicly accessible resources will be designed so that also disabled
  can access it.

  User profiles can be customised to meet the user's individual needs. The portal will provide
  different layouts for each of the user types.
 
  The whole portal and applications which are accessed 
  through the it have a consistent look and feel. 

  All resources will carry a clear copyright notice where the resources are not in the 
  public domain. 

-Are the pictures mockups or screenshots from existing system?
  There is a link to a guide for NHS identity which includes visual 
  examples, but the document itself doesn't
  include mockups or screenshots.

-Transitions between views
  The portal has a consistent look and feel.

****************************************
Your point of view
****************************************
-Is it a good/bad document? Why?
  It is a good document. It follows the structure of a Software requirements specification and is clear. 
-Consider also the quality of diagrams / illustrations
  There weren’t too many diagrams or illustrations, only one. More diagrams would have made the document clearer.
-Do you think there would be enough information for you to build that system?
	Yes.
