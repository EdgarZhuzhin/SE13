4. System architecture
=======================

High-level overview of the system  
Main modules and their functions represented

The application requires system modules for positioning, navigation and authentication.
The most basic function of the application is to show the user's and his or hers friends and foes locations on a map.
Also most actions of the application heavily rely on this fundamental functionality. Because of the importance of 
positioning within the system it should be considered a main module.

Navigation is provided to find friends within the building while avoiding foes. Again this is a relatively important feature
of the application and it should be considered a main module which is dependant on the positioning module. User positions
are needed for any navigation to be accomplished. In this case the position of foes affects the navigation route, since foes
should always be avoided. This active navigation is dependant on the movement of both the friends the user is trying to get
to and the foes he or she is trying to avoid. A new route is calculated if a foe disturbs the current route.

In order to keep track of users an authentication module is necessary. It is essential for distinguishing users from each 
other and providing the right stored data to the client such as the friend and foe lists. The positioning system needs 
information about the user to provide other users the information who is in a certain position on the map, a friend or a foe.
Furthermore only people within friends or foes are shown and this distinction is crucial.
